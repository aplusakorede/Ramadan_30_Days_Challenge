> **We'll be reviewing the story of Prophet Ibrahim(A.S) and his unwavering faith in Allah**

The task for Day 2 of Ramadan 30 days Challenge involves reading about the Prophet, memorizing and reciting

> Recite the daily Taraweeh prayers and attend congregational prayers at the mosque (if possible).


## ℹ️ Details

- Taraweeh is a special prayer performed during the Islamic month of `Ramadan`, typically after the `Isha` prayer. 

- It consists of 8 or 20 units of prayer (rakat), recited in pairs, and usually takes about an hour to complete.

- Many `Muslims` consider `Taraweeh` prayer to be a communal activity and will attend their local `mosque` to perform it. It is not mandatory, 

- but it is highly recommended for Muslims to participate in `Taraweeh` during `Ramadan` as it is considered a blessed and rewarding act of worship.

### 📒Reading

Read about the story of Prophet Ibrahim(A.S) and his unwavering faith in Allah, even in the most difficult of circumstances. 
Reflect on the importance of putting our trust in Allah and the rewards that come with it.

Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) is one of the most revered and respected prophets in Islam. He is also known as Khalilulah, which means 'the friend of Allah'.
Ibrahim (AS) was tested by Allah through severe trials and challenges, but he always showed an unwavering faith and respect towards his Lord. 
He is considered the forefather of many great prophets and is held in high esteem by all the major revealed religions.

Reflecting on the story of Prophet Ibrahim (AS) and his steadfastness in faith despite difficult circumstances can remind us of the importance of putting our trust in Allah. 
It is through this trust that we can find peace and contentment in our lives, knowing that Allah is always in control and that everything happens according to His divine plan.
It can also remind us of the rewards that come with this trust and belief in Allah, both in this life and the hereafter.
