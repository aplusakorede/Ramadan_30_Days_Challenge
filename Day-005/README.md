The task for Day 4 of `Ramadan 30 days Challenge` involves learning about the story of `Prophet Musa(A.S)` and his mission to free the Israelites from slavery in Egypt
Reflect on the importance of courage, determination, and reliance on Allah.

## ℹ️ Details

The story of `Prophet Musa (Moses)(A.S)` is a well-known tale in Islamic tradition. `Musa` was born in Egypt during a time when the `Pharaoh` was enslaving the Israelites.

Fearing for his safety, Musa's mother placed him in a basket and set him afloat on the Nile River.

The basket was discovered by the `Pharaoh's` wife, who took Musa in and raised him as her own son.

As Musa grew older, he became aware of the plight of his people and felt a calling from `Allah` to help free them from slavery.

With `Allah's` guidance, `Musa` confronted the `Pharaoh` and demanded that he release the `Israelites`.

The `Pharaoh` refused, and `Allah` sent down a series of plagues to persuade him to change his mind.

Despite the `Pharaoh's` continued resistance, Musa remained steadfast in his mission and relied on `Allah` for guidance and strength. 

In the end, `Allah` granted `Musa` and the `Israelites` victory, and they were able to leave `Egypt` and start a new life of freedom.

Reflecting on this story, we can learn the importance of courage, determination, and reliance on `Allah`.

`Musa` displayed immense courage in standing up to the `Pharaoh` and demanding the release of the `Israelites`, despite the risks involved. 

He was also determined to see his mission through to the end, even in the face of adversity and hardship.

Additionally, `Musa's` unwavering reliance on `Allah` played a crucial role in his success. 

He turned to Allah`` for guidance and strength throughout his journey, and it was `Allah's` support that ultimately enabled him to achieve victory.

In our own lives, we can draw inspiration from `Musa's` story and strive to emulate his qualities of courage, determination, and reliance on Allah.

Whether we are facing personal struggles or working towards a larger goal, we can find strength and guidance through our faith in `Allah` and our commitment to our mission

So take what I have given you and be among the grateful." And We wrote for him on the tablets [something] of all things - instruction and explanation for all things, [saying],
"Take them with determination and order your people to take the best of it. I will show you the home of the defiantly disobedient."
