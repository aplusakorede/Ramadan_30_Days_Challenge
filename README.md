1. If you dont have any prior programming knowledge skip this step

``` c

2. Navigate to the folder for the current day's task. For example, to access the task for Day 1, navigate to the day-1 folder.
3. Read the task instructions in the README.md file for the current day. This file will also contain any resources or references you need to complete the task.
4. Complete the task and reflect on your progress.

I recommend that you start each day's task in the morning to give yourself enough time to complete it and reflect on your progress. You can also personalize each task by adding your own insights or experiences.

## What to expect

Over the next 30 days, you can expect to receive daily tasks and challenges that are designed to help you increase your worship, connection with Allah, and acts of kindness and charity. These tasks are meant to complement your regular worship and are not meant to replace it. You can expect a variety of tasks, such as memorizing a new surah from the Quran, waking up for suhoor and praying Fajr on time, donating to a charity, spending extra time in worship, and performing an act of kindness for someone else. The tasks are designed to be manageable and should not take up too much of your time.

## Task Schedule

Each day, you will receive a task that is specifically designed to help you achieve a specific goal or objective. I have carefully curated the tasks to ensure that they are both practical and beneficial. Some of the tasks will require you to take action, while others will involve reflection or introspection. Each task is designed to be achievable and realistic, so you can easily incorporate it into your daily routine.

I recommend that you take some time at the beginning of each day to review the task and any relevant resources or reference links. This will help you gain a better understanding of the task and its purpose, and will also ensure that you are prepared to complete it.

I believe that the task schedule will help you stay on track and make the most of your Ramadan experience

## Resources

Throughout the 30-day Ramadan Challenge, you may find that you need additional resources to complete some of the daily tasks and challenges. I have compiled a list of helpful resources that you can use to enhance your Ramadan experience and deepen your knowledge and understanding of Islam.

Each day's task will include any necessary resources or reference links that you need to complete it. I will provide links to relevant articles, videos, or websites that will help you gain a better understanding of the task and its purpose. These resources are carefully curated to ensure that they are accurate, informative, and helpful.

I hope that these resources will enhance your Ramadan experience and deepen your connection to Islam. If you have any suggestions for additional resources that you think would be helpful, please let me know by emailing [Abdulsamad](jimohsamad2005@gmail.com).
